# Overcoming Obstacles

On an individual basis, we never know what someone is experiencing on a daily basis in their personal lives aside 
from being a full time or in many cases a part time student. Generally, it is safe to say that we all deal with 
obstacles at some point or another in our lives. Some obstacles are in our inner circle of influence while others 
are in our outer circle of influence. Discern which circle of influence the obstacle is in and deal with it
accordingly. Here are   tips to help you overcome obstacles in your life.

1.Self Care
First things first, you have to take care of yourself. I understand having to make sacrifices, but keep in mind
a barrier to make sacrifices is created when you don't take care of yourself. Get the daily nourishment you need, 
time for yourself,(Even if that means in the car) proper amount of sleep and the rest of your needs are met as 
well.

2.Fear
It plays an important role in the processing of emotions, including fear. When we are afraid, it sets off a 
sophisticated, coordinated response in our brains and bodies.The body also releases cortisol in response to 
ACTH, which brings about the rise in blood pressure, blood sugar, and white blood cells.
Fear is meant to serve as a warning sign, however when you allow yourself to become paralyzed by fear, that is 
something completely different. Fear can impair formation of long-term memories and cause damage to certain parts 
of the brain, such as the hippocampus. This can make it even more difficult to regulate fear and can leave a 
person anxious most of the time. To someone in chronic fear, the world looks scary and their memories confirm 
that. It plays an important role in the processing of emotions, including fear. When we are afraid, it sets off a 
sophisticated, coordinated response in our brains and bodies. The body also releases cortisol in response to
ACTH, which brings about the rise in blood pressure, blood sugar, and white blood cells.

3.Self Entitlement
A sense of entitlement is defined as "an unrealistic, unmerited or inappropriate expectation of favorable living
conditions and favorable treatment at the hands of others."

4.Perfectionism
In psychology, perfectionism is a personality trait characterized by “a person's striving for flawlessness and 
setting excessively high performance standards, accompanied by overly critical self-evaluations and concerns 
regarding others' evaluations.”

5.Learn from your failure
I am a firm believer that if you don't learn the first time, you will defenitely repeat the lesson. There isn't 
any reason to reinvent the wheel. You possess the luxury of learning from the mistakes of others. Take the time 
to evaluate and revaluate
.
6.Take small steps
Setting and accomplishing goals can feel like an insurmountable obstacle. The key is taking small steps to make
progress towards your goal. Create a realistic list of action items — things you can actually do, right now, to 
make progress. It is important for you to understand how to break down your big goal into smaller attainable 
goals. It is easy to get overwhelmed by trying to take on too much at one time. 


7.Make no excuses
It doesn't much to make excuses and in doing so you loose grip of your "why". Don't forget the reason you made 
the decision to invest your time in your learning process. The quickest way to avoid making excuses is to take 
action. Take the steps necessary to leave no room for excuses under any circumstance. Take full responsibility of 
your outcome and be accountable for your actions. Never give up and you will make it!

8.Step outside your comfort zone
If you're uncomfortable, you are probably doing something right. I encourage you to continue to push yourself to do things that you have never done before and of course things that are conducive to your learning process. Some of the best things happen when you are uncomfortable.

9.Do Not procrastinate 
Procrastination is expensive. In the event you find yourself putting something off, because it feels like it is 
too much and it becomes overwhelming, evaluate your objectives, devise a plan and take immediate action. It may 
seem like it is too much to do, but if you break down your objective in steps and pace yourself, you will be
sucessful. Check out this link for some helpful tips about overcoming procrastination.

1.Build a support system and gain perspective
Build a support system for yourself that is conducive to your learning process. Exposure is also key when it 
comes to building a support system. Therapy is amazing if you have never experiened it. Check with your community
agency for some resources for affordable therapy and in some cases you may qualify to recieve the servicee free
of charge. Your perception is everything and it will determine how you approach the obstacle. Make a decision to 
be positive no matter what. In short we attract what we think and our thoughts determing how we handle things in 
life. Mentors are an excellent source to assist with navigating through obstacles and overcoming them. Be 
cautious of what you allow to take root in your life. Last, but not least, never forget your "Why".
