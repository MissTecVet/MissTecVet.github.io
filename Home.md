#Self Learning
According to Malcom Knowles, self-learning is defined as: “a process by which individuals take the initiative, with or without  
the assistance of others, in diagnosing their learning needs, formulating learning goals, identifying human and material 
resources for learning, and evaluating learning outcomes”.Dec 12, 2018 Self learning is an integration of formal and informal 
learning. Independent study takes integrity, self discipline, time management and determination. It can be quite challenging for 
me to balance work, home, school, groups and children. At times it can be extremely overwhelming and complex.
The abilty to work at your own pace and drive the learning process is ideal for individuals who are single parents such as 
myself. There are insurmountable resources availble to assist with self learning.
Here are five tips for practicing successful self-study:
1. Prepare and maintain your study environment
It is important to have a nice, clean and quiet work space to study.
2. Set SMART goals
 SMART. S.M.A.R.T. is an acronym that stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely.
3. Increase your support. ...
Exposure is imperative, so you want to make sure you are networking every chance you get.
4. Repetition reinforces 
The more times you do something, it makes it difficult to forget.
5. Study in short, frequent sessions. ...
 Breaks improve consistency and clarity.
